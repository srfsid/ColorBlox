# ColorBlox

I have made this game while I was learning Java. At the time I was a novice on java. So I tried to keep things as simple as possible.

## Objective:
At the start of the game you will be presented a colorful grid of 25x25 tiles. Each tile will have a color randomly chosen from six colors. Player have to click on the tiles in order to select an area of same color and help grow that area. Everytime player clicks on a new color the area will have that color. When all the tiles are of same color the game will end.
